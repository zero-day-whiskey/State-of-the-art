Heyoooo

It's 10.55, I just have 5 min before the next call.
A couple of quick thoughts:
1. Screen time last week was 2:39, which is a 23% decline from the previous week
2. Beware of loopholes, because you're a ingenius motherfucker. Yesterday I wrote down that I should not start the day looking at the phone and you know what? I didn't! I was able to not look at the phone until I stood up from the bed. But guess what: I opened the laptop and wasted 15 minutes there.... You need to take yourself seriously, this is the bottom line. Even if there is a loophole, think about the objective and goal of that limitation that you impose on yourself

Hopping on the call now, talk later.
