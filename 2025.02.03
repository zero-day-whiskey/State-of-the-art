Heyoooo

It's 10.55, I just have 5 min before the next call.
A couple of quick thoughts:
1. Screen time last week was 2:39, which is a 23% decline from the previous week, which is awesome. At the same time,
2. Beware of loopholes, because you're a ingenius motherfucker. Yesterday I wrote down that I should not start the day looking at the phone and you know what? I didn't! I was able to not look at the phone until I stood up from the bed. But guess what: I opened the laptop and wasted 15 minutes there.... You need to take yourself seriously, this is the bottom line. Even if there is a loophole, think about the objective and goal of that limitation that you impose on yourself

Hopping on the call now, talk later.

Update:
It's 23:00 now. Shitty day overall. I spent too much time on the phone. Also, at work, I felt like I didn't close anything.
Also, last consideration, I want to keep this brief: eating pizza twice a day is detrimental to your health. You're going toward gluten sensitivity or something like that, considering how much you eat this shit. And btw, glovo... Why do you keep trying. It's shit and you know that. Don't fall into the trap that makes you think it's easier than the alternative. Because you're always let down.
