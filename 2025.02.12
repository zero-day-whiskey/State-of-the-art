Heyo

it's me again, I'm still here.
It's been quite a few interesting days and I've been super busy to say the least. We're now live with the project at work.
Today the partner called, congratulating me and saying that I've been doing a good job etc.
For the past week or even longer, my manager has been congratulating me and saying that he appreciates my approach, my standing and abilities.
Today I got contacted by a recruiter reaching out for a job prospect and by a supplier asking for me to essentially place her product onto the projects that I'm working on

So, if you see the positives, life is working out decently

On top of this, today I was even able to go out running (even though it was raining and air quality was terrible!!), which I haven't done in a minute now (at least 10 days), so props to me

So I'd say, overall life is looking good

Next week I'm travelling to Milan, which is always nice to change up a bit the scenario and everything

Anyway, having said this, I want to go to sleep now (it's almost midnight, and in 6 hours I have an alarm).

oh and btw, I wanna buy a Raspberry. not sure if I wrote it here before, but it's something that I want to start learning
