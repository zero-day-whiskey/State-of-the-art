I have 1:05 as screen time. Not good. I mean, much better than yesterday, etc., but it's still a lot.
And I've felt the urge to check for notification etc. every 10 minutes or so. Even though the phone is in a place where I can see it and therefore I can see when I receive a new notification because the fucking screen lights up.
I need to get rid of this sense of: I need to check it! I need dopamine!

Off to work again, see ya later

Damn, this life is tiring.
Today was a full day at work, non-stop, but that's how I like it. I also realized that I like particularly to be able to advance on stuff, to close open points, and to build.
Key word, building.

As mentioned in the past to friends, when reflecting on life choices and my uni background, I've realized, probably too late that I like to build and create, instead of interpreting/theorizing, etc.
The bachelor in Economics that I got was really interesting and helped me a lot by providing me a framework to interpret the world with, and a set of rules/mechanisms that would help me set some constants upon which I can build my interpretations.
Having said this, I am a builder. I like to build. I like to create. And when I get to do it, I feel fulfilled, like my time is worth.

Anyway, setting this tangent aside, and going back to the point of this morning: 2:36
