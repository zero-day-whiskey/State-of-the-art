Update: 
it's now 11:35

I have 1:05 as screen time. Not good. I mean, much better than yesterday, etc., but it's still a lot.
And I've felt the urge to check for notification etc. every 10 minutes or so. Even though the phone is in a place where I can see it and therefore I can see when I receive a new notification because the fucking screen lights up.
I need to get rid of this sense of: I need to check it! I need dopamine!

Off to work again, see ya later
