I have 1:05 as screen time. Not good. I mean, much better than yesterday, etc., but it's still a lot.
And I've felt the urge to check for notification etc. every 10 minutes or so. Even though the phone is in a place where I can see it and therefore I can see when I receive a new notification because the fucking screen lights up.
I need to get rid of this sense of: I need to check it! I need dopamine!

Off to work again, see ya later

Damn, this life is tiring.
Today was a full day at work, non-stop, but that's how I like it. I also realized that I like particularly to be able to advance on stuff, to close open points, and to build.
Key word, building.

As mentioned in the past to friends, when reflecting on life choices and my uni background, I've realized, probably too late that I like to build and create, instead of interpreting/theorizing, etc.
The bachelor in Economics that I got was really interesting and helped me a lot by providing me a framework to interpret the world with, and a set of rules/mechanisms that would help me set some constants upon which I can build my interpretations.
Having said this, I am a builder. I like to build. I like to create. And when I get to do it, I feel fulfilled, like my time is worth.

Anyway, setting this tangent aside, and going back to the point of this morning: 2:37 hours. That's my screen time for the day. Which would be awesome, if it was my average, but my average as of now is like 3:15.
On monday I spent a whole lot of time browsing stupid stuff (primarely twitter I'd say. lately it's my favourite social media), so that raised the average a lot. Also, keep in mind that during the week end, usually, I spend a lot more time on the phone, so: (1) I need to lower the time in the week, as much as possible, (2) I need to limit the time in the weekend as well, otherwise it doesn't take much to surpass my goals.

Anyway, the balance is positive, the day went well. I'm happy when I'm busy and I'm building.
Today I wasn't able to exercise, but that's ok, considering that last week I did it 0 times basically (if we exclude saturday's run), this week we are already at 2, and it's just Wednesday. Well, now it's Thursday, so technically, in about 21 hours, I will do some exercises. The plan is to do abs today, friday chest and saturday a run. 
This is another point that I need to dig deeper into: a solid schedule that can match my calendar. For example, instead of taking a rest day during the weekend, I could rest 2 days during the week. Or even three.
Meaning that if I'm able to reach a total of 4 times of phisical exercise during the week, I'd be already stoked! Considering that Tue and Thu are office-days, I could take those two off for sure and potentially another one (need to decide when). 
Additionally to this shenanigans, I should also dig deeper into (a) a dietary regimen for muscle gain, (b) best exercise routine/regimen, (c) best exercises to recover from shoulder pain. 

Don't think that I forgot about the initial post of this series. I did declare some goals, and for each of these my aim is to first of all expand on it, and then, obviously, accomplish it.
We'll talk tomorrow evening I guess, now I'm off to bed since the alarm clock is set to ring in about 6 hours
