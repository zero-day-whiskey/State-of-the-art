Ideally I'd sit down now and write a small essay, like I did yesterday and the day before.
But damn, is it tiring waking up at 5:30 and going hard, all day, non-stop, at work until 8pm. It's basically a 12 hour long work-day and 17 hour long day, so I don't really have the energy to actually dive deeper into this stuff

In any case, just as a quick recap, even today I was able to train a bit (did some bicepts) and I was able to cook at home.
Hey, that's progress, if you consider that in the past I would have simply ate delivery food and laid in bed non-stop
Instead I found the energy to do at least that

But If I had to be completely frank, I would also say that I have notice that if I start messing with a screen of some kind, time flies and as good and as strong-willed I can be, still I would end up getting sucked into the screen itself.
So, given the above (btw, yesterday I spent 4 hours and 30 minutes at the phone (I worked from home); today I will spent just shy of 3 hours total, which is till about 2 hours too many, but it's a huge improvement over the 4:30), i need to focus my attention in limiting the times I get exposed to this stuff.
Just pick up less the phone.
Just refresh youtube once less.
If you do it over and over again, it won't take much until you limit drastically the time spent there.
I would also add that, given the strongly decreasing marginal returns, the first 30/45 minutes spent scrolling twitter/snapchat/reddit are relatively useful/entertaining, but after that it's just doom-scrolling. On top of that, if you limit screen time to, say, 1-hour a day, those saved up hours will be much more productive because you will not have been affected by the side effects of doom-scrolling.

2nd week of january, screen time: 4:48
3rd week of january, screen time: 4:05 (-43 min, or 15% less)
4rh week of january, screen time: 3:27 (-38 min, or 15% less)

Let's try to keep this decrease rate until the end of february.
This would take me to the following times:

1st week of February, screen time: 2:56 (-31 min, or 15% less)
2nd week of February, screen time: 2:30 (-26 min, or 15% less)
3rd week of February, screen time: 2:07 (-23 min, or 15% less)
4rh week of February, screen time: 1:48 (-19 min, or 15% less)

If I kepts 1 hour and 48 minutes as daily average of each week starting from march onward, that'd be altready a huge success
If it doesn't seem like one, try to reflect how much 2 hours a day could change things
It would make you hugely more efficient and you'd live more in the moment, instead of being a victim of time passing by


To start, let's try to wake up at a decent time and leave social media alone for the beginning of the day, at least for tomorrow. We'll think about the day after, tomorrow evening. For now let's focus on the next task at hand.

Update, it's the day after, 8:45, just before firing up the work-laptop:

A couple of quick thoughts:
- I woke up at 6:45, spent the first 20 minutes of the day on the phone, then got up
  Of course, not ideal to have the phone in front of your face first thing of the day (especially that early) but it's a process, so it'll take me a while to get there. But I will, eventually.
  As an addendum, keep in mind that directionally you're going down the right path, but it's a long process. Just keep at it and you'll get there
- Time spent on podcasts (and spotify, etc., I assume they work similarly) does not count toward the scree time above (not even in the stats that the iPhone gives out)
- Waking up with so little time spent on the phone AND then going to get coffe AND going to the grocery store to pick up a couple of cases of water feels like the day has started in the right direction...
  I've already been active and it's not 9 yet.
- Last point, and then we'll catch up in about 12 hours: keep out negativity. Either thoughts that emerge from within, or thoughts that are pushed from the environment. It's incredible the difference it makes. As much as I'd like to say that I don't get influenced, that's not true, so work towards curating your surroundings and keep a clean place. Your mind and soul will benefit from it

Off to work now, see ya
