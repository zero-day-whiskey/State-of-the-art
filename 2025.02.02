I'ts about 20:00 now.

Today has been overall a pretty shitty day but I've got a few takeaways:
1.  Picking up the phone, first thing in the morning, is detrimental. The death of me. Once you open your eyes, just stand up, right then and there. Go wash your face, prepare breakfast and if you still feel the need to pickup the phone, do it when you eat breakfast. But I assure you, you will not feel that urge anymore, at least not as much.
2.  Not having a clear thing to do next, it's just as detrimental. Yestarday I drafted that to-do list, but apparently there was too much friction in it. Not sure why, but I actually never got to any point (at least not the significant ones). To-Dos need to be actionable. I quote: "While the terminology I use here (“next concrete step”) is derived from David Allen’s Getting Things Done, a lot of the principles here are (perhaps even unconsciously) applied in Extreme Programming (XP). Extreme Programming is presented as this system for keeping programs organized, but I find that a lot of it is actually good advice for avoid procrastination. For example, pair programming automatically spreads the mental weight of the task across two people as well as giving people something useful to do during lower-quality time. Breaking a project down into concrete steps is another key part of XP, as is getting something that works done right away and improving on it (“Simplify it” infra). And these are just the things that aren’t programming-specific".

3.  It's very important to do something during the day that makes you feel energized. Usually, getting things done, is energizing in itself, but sometimes you don't have the energy to begin getting things done. When this is the case, generally speaking, getting outside helps. Either going for a walk, going for a run, people watching and observing at the mall, or something as simple as going to get groceries. So, next time you feel like you don't want to get anything done, just start from this very small and seemingly unconsequential thing, which in fact can act as a catalyst for getting more stuff done further down the line. 
4.  You like driving, but you like doing so in free-open roads, without speed limits. Driving in the city, or when there are speed cameras everywhere, it's not as fulfilling. In fact, it could be frustrating
5.  Sleeping too much hurts (a) your neck, (b) your productivity (you wake up feeling like you were wasting time, so the first thought of the day is already negative. Next thought is: oh yeah, then fuck it, let's waste the whole day, it's already un-recoverable) and (c) your mood. It makes you sluggish.

Picking back up my to-do list for the weekend, we are here:
1.  Either run a bit, or at least do some abs/biceps ----------------------> OOOOOOOOOKKKKKKKKKK
2.  Read at least 1h ----------------------> OOOOOOOOOKKKKKKKKKK
3.  Keep phone screen time below 100 minutes ----------------------> Kinda OOOOOOOOOKKKKKKKKKK
4.  Write to irish friend to catch up
5.  Tidy up and clean the room ----------------------> OOOOOOOOOKKKKKKKKKK
6.  Eviscerate some other goals stated in the origin story (lol)
7.  Pay rent ----------------------> OOOOOOOOOKKKKKKKKKK
8.  Send 2/3 low-stake applications ----------------------> OOOOOOOOOKKKKKKKKKK
9.  Learn a bit more about this blogging stuff. As of now this is... well, improvised, to say the least. Self-hosting, doing it locally (Obsidian?), leveraging GitHub? No idea.
10. Clean photos, bookmarks, etc. as stated on your window. Literally the glass window on your left. Turn your fucking head left and read what you wrote
11. Ideally work for 2/3 hours (WF/EP/Business Email)
