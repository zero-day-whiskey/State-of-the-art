Update, it's now the day after

Yesterday was shit
I got nothing done, I have all these goals and things that I wanted to get done, but basically I spent the whole day napping/waisting time on social media/watching old podcasts that I've already listened to

I always need to remember two things, mainly:
1. lean towards action rather than thought
2. have a list of priorities/goals

If you think all the time, or if you don't have a goal/actionable tasks to work toward, you are not getting anywhere. 
But if you do have a list of operative tasks and lean towards getting them done rather than trying to find the optimal way to do something, then you'll be unstoppable. This are my two cents
Now I'm gonna try to get done what I need to and close the weekend with 0 pending tasks compared to what I had in mind yesterday


Update:
- read for 2 hours

Need to do:
- work for 1.5 hours
- clean room - 30 minutes
- shower + beard/hair - 45 minutes
- read for 4 hours
- running research - 1 hour (find routine, podcast/coach, etc.)
- chest/abs - 30 minutes
