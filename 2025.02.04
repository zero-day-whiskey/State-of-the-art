Quick update

honestly, there's not much to update today. I got up at 6, went to the office at 7, and got back at 9pm. 
After that, chinese take-away, some podcasts, some additional work (slides fine-tuning) and that's it.

Between today and the day before, I got back about 4 rejections out of 6 applications sent. Considering the last two companies that still need to give me a feedback, it's gonna be a 100% rejection rate.
Which is fine, 6 applications is a low number, and they were very low-stake applications, but the job market is definitely trickier than 2023. 
Therefore I need to double down with the number of applications. Like 2x per day.
