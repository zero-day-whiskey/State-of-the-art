Heyyooo

It's saturday, about 8.30 am. I woke up at 7 but laid in bed until 7.45, browsing, scrolling, thinking about life. Got up and went to get coffee, as usual by now. And I say coffee, but I should say ginseng.
Even though the weather is gloomy today I think I'm going to head out for a run at some point (just checked air quality and it's so shitty that I might have to postpone, we'll see).

Anyway, as I was saying yesterday (in the 30.01 commit) I started to cheat a little. I am already "giving up" on this new endeavor of keeping track of thoughts and sharing them with the world. Not giving up per s√®, but I struggle to find the time. Doing something like this at the end of the day when you're depleted is really challenging, but I need to keep at it and be consistent.

In fact, as I see it, I could do something like this:
1. Fire up this baby boy before work, so that I can put down a quick list of things I want to accomplish that day. Let's call them priority of the day
2. Compare at the end of the day, the planned vs actual, and reflect, in retrospect, what could've gone better and how I should have approached it in an ideal world

On top of this, oviously add random thoughts, goals, complaints, etc.
