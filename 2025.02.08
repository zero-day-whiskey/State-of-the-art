Damn

Almost an entire week went by without an update. My bad, I apologize. You know, life took over, as they say. It's a very intense period, we're about to go live with the project at work.
It feels good though, working towards something, instead of just wandering around, aimlessly. Typing this, I realized this is a very common and recurring theme for me. The "aimless wandering" one, apparently is something I feel very deeply so there's an improvement area right there. And you know what.. Writing about this stuff makes me pumped up about personal growth and stuff, because the very fact that my language changed (and therefore, somewhat, the PoV as well) and I see it as an improvement area instead of a weakness, it shows character development I think.

Anyway, I was getting sidetracked.
Let's see.. Updates, updates.... What else happened
I got again into motorcycling, meaning that I got back to watching travelling videos of people moving with their bikes, setting up camps with tents and shieet. You know, this is a world that fascinates me a lot, I don't even know why. Maybe it's just the aesthetic part of it, maybe it's overly romanticized, maybe it's my idea of picking up girls or something, either way it fascinates me a lot.
And you know what.. I could buy a pretty decent bike for 3500 euro, or something like that. So if you add gear you get to 4500 max (including taxes, etc.). Which is not too bad. But then I think about where to park it (do I need a garage?), I think about theft risk (do I need additional insurance for stuff like that?), and this makes me reluctant. Maybe reluctant is not the right word, but at least hesitant.
I need to think about it seriously and understand if it's something viable (and get a quotation for insurance and stuff like that. Considering that it's my first bike and that I live in a big city, that might carry a hefty price)

Another update that I have is that my screen time has gone down vertically basically! This is HUGE! I went from spending about 3.5 hours a day on the phone, to 2 hours a day, in the span of 10 days. This is a huge accomplishement that, considering how addictive my personality can get, is really huge and not to be undervalued. I am doing far better that the projection and goals that I've set for me
