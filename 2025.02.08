Damn

Almost an entire week went by without an update. My bad, I apologize. You know, life took over, as they say. It's a very intense period, we're about to go live with the project at work.
It feels good though, working towards something, instead of just wandering around, aimlessly. Typing this, I realized this is a very common and recurring theme for me. The "aimless wandering" one, apparently is something I feel very deeply so there's an improvement area right there. And you know what.. Writing about this stuff makes me pumped up about personal growth and stuff, because the very fact that my language changed (and therefore, somewhat, the PoV as well) and I see it as an improvement area instead of a weakness, it shows character development I think.

Anyway, I was getting sidetracked.
Let's see.. Updates, updates.... What else happened

I got again into motorcycling, meaning that I got back to watching travelling videos of people moving with their bikes, setting up camps with tents and shieet. You know, this is a world that fascinates me a lot, I don't even know why. Maybe it's just the aesthetic part of it, maybe it's overly romanticized, maybe it's my idea of picking up girls or something, either way it fascinates me a lot.
And you know what.. I could buy a pretty decent bike for 3500 euro, or something like that. So if you add gear you get to 4500 max (including taxes, etc.). Which is not too bad. But then I think about where to park it (do I need a garage?), I think about theft risk (do I need additional insurance for stuff like that?), and this makes me reluctant. Maybe reluctant is not the right word, but at least hesitant.
I need to think about it seriously and understand if it's something viable (and get a quotation for insurance and stuff like that. Considering that it's my first bike and that I live in a big city, that might carry a hefty price)

Another update that I have is that my screen time has gone down vertically basically! This is HUGE! I went from spending about 3.5 hours a day on the phone, to 2 hours a day, in the span of 10 days. This is a huge accomplishement that, considering how addictive my personality can get, is really huge and not to be undervalued. I am doing far better that the projection and goals that I've set for me on the 28th of january. 
Either way, I havent reached my goal yet, and from time to time I still slip up and find a workaround (e.g., I either waste time from my pc or ipad, instead of the phone, which doesn't get included in my screen time, as of now), so it's important not to lose focus of the final goal and always be intentional in your actions. Being intentional and having a goal when doing stuff I think it's important. If I try to remove the unhealthy habit of "just let me open the [Insert_social_media] home page and let me see what's happening/the recommendations" I will be doing 1000% better than I was before. That's the main thing that fucks me up and makes me waste so much time. Just opening twitter/youtube/reddit, randomly, without an objective, and "seeing what happens". Which always turns into scrolling for hours and hours to get the next dopamine hit. I think it's ok to use socials, and my objective is not to reach 0 usage, but either let it be intentional (i.e., I want to open youtube to watch the latest david dobrik video, and that's it) or let it be limited (i.e., I just want to get a quick update of what's happeing on twitter, I allow myself for a 5 minutes scroll, and that's it). No more picking up the phone at every chance I get, in between calls, during calls, etc.

Another update: job applications. I got rejected for all 5/6 applications I sent. Makes sense tbh, even though if I have to be honest I was hoping to get a call back at least. You know how I am, I always shoot for the stars and I have high expectations. Either way, I'm not "let down" per se, of course I was hoping to get something out of it, but such is life. I haven't really put much thought, neither into the application process itself, nor in processing the rejections, so it's business as usual. If I have to be honest, I don't know if I want to keep applying now. Not because of fear of rejection or stuff, but because I think that (a) the job market now is pretty bad so I'd get a worse ROI that I got in 2023; (b) because I got some signals from managers at my current job that I'm getting considered more. I'm definitely not in the "inner circle", see previous rants, but I think that I have behaved in such a way that I built some trust.  

In terms of phisical activity, unfortunately I've been slacking. As I've said before, I need to get a plan so that I know which exercises comprise my routine and I can try building it/sticking to it. Otherwise, again, If I do random stuff all the time, it's far far easier to just say "fuck it". Or begin something and giving up 5 minutes later.

Last, but not least: reading. I have done 0 reading this week, exactly as I did in the previous 5/6 weeks. I need to get back in the groove.

Plans for the weekend:
- work - 4 hours
- clean room - 30 minutes
- shower + beard/hair - 45 minutes
- grocery shopping - 45 minutes
- reading - 3 hours saturday, 3 hours sunday
- researching bike stuff (i.e., does it get damaged without a roof over its head, insurance costs, etc.) - 2 hours
- go running - 1 hour
- running research - 1 hour (find routine, podcast/coach, etc.)
- chest/abs - 30 minutes
