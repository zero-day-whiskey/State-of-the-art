So

Here we are, I'm back.

I want to turn this into a habit, so my goal, among the ones that I listed yesterday, is to go at it and be consistent.
In fact, one of the main things that I want to dissect and deep dive into, is the act of dedication and its interrelation with habit forming, agency and success.
It's not enough to list out goals, which I did already, even though at a relatively high-level. The next step is to reverse engineer these goals and get to a list of actionable tasks that, when put in place with a certain commitment and dedication, can guide me through the mundane and the ordinary in reaching my milestones.

Apologies in advance for being obvious from time to time (or all-the-time), but I think that before everything else, just pouring out my thoughts can be, itself, an aid in clarifying the bigger picture.

So, let's try to dissect and dive deeper into the single goals that I listed yesterday.

1.I.   Learning to Code

    a. Generally speaking, especially now that LLMs are spreading and coding is less valuable than before, I don't want to learn "coding" in general, aimlessly. (Notice how the theme of having an objective         to work toward is recurring)
    b. Given that, wnat I mean by "learning to code" is that I want to have a foundation of some very basic IT concepts, such as: DNS, Proxy, API, IPs, Servers, etc. 
    c. Not for the sake of knowing stuff, but for the sake of building. For example, I'd like to self-host these thoughts in my personal blog. No wordpress, none of that shit. I'd like to be able to build          from scratch something (see, I don't even know what I need) that would help me get there
    d. Another example is pi-hole or being able to automate tasks with a macropad. Also, other than software, I'm getting quite interested in hardware as well. For example, raspberry pi, arduino, the               macropad itself, are all things that, on a level, fascinate me

1.II.  Learn to play an instrument

    a. Here there is not that much to say. But maybe, I'm wrong.
    b. Essentially I think in my life I've always lacked this part, I've never had a creative outlet and I realized later that instead of learning for the sake of learning, or learning for the sake of              interpreting (as I like to think my Uni taught me), I need to be able to express myself and to build! Music, I think that would allow me to do both.
       One thing that's pretty sad about it is that, if I've had the itch in the past to lear to produce music (there was a period when I bought midi+keyboard and I was dabbling with LogicPro), today I feel        like do to AI being able to do it I have less motivation. Pretty fucked up if you think about it, but this is a me-issue that I should address if I really found it blocking/limiting
    c. So, getting back to the main point, between it being a mean of expression and it helping me release some creativity, I also think that this stuff would get my synapses working better and those               bitches would fire and jump across those bridges. What was it? Dendritis, Axon Terminals and some other stuff. Sapolsky I'm sorry I've let you down. I'll try to be a better macaque
    d. Why guitar and piano? Well. Both for the easy of use and portability I guess. Guitar seems like a good beginner instrument. Piano I think would me more in line with me and would fit better, overall,         with my personality, whatever that means
    e. So, since I have both of these, maybe I'd better start and do something about it, what do you think? As an example, I could bring here the Piano from back home, so that at least I don't have anymore         excuses. Before doing so I could buy the stand, or whatever that thing is called

1.III. Learn how to say no and stand my ground, both politely and in heated situations

    a. Here the situation gets complicated, but at the same time simpler. Meaning that generally speaking, I've known that this is an improvement area for a while now. And I actually did improve a lot!
    b. So it's not doing the thing, per se, but beign more comfortable in doing it in such a way that I understand that even though I might offend/let down the counterpart, I still have to stand my ground          because I (should) come first. It happened a lot in my personal life, but it happened much more when working, especially because my job requires a lot of client-interaction and I find it difficult to        say stuff like "no we can't do it" or "no, this is a product limitation". Which obviously, on one side, pushes me to deliver more and to push further the limits and capabilities that the tool offers, 
       but on the other side makes me feel like I owe them something. When, in fact, I should just use these as times to improve my ability to dance around questioins, politely decline to answer or simply          changing the direction of the conversation. 
    c. In any case, long story short: this is an ongoing issue/opportunity. I've grown a lot in this regard, but there is still a lot of work to do. My approach derives mainly from my upbringing, with all          its limits and traumas, but it nonetheless brought me here.

1.IV.  Learn being more assertive

    a. This links very well with the above points in 1.III.
    b. Assertiveness is the quality of being self-assured and confident without being aggressive to defend a right point of view or a relevant statement. It is a skill that can be learned
    c. I think that the definition is pretty self explanatory and my aim as well. 
    d. Due to my upbringing and past I think that I've always leaned more on the agreable side and I've always preferred to let the other part win instead of facing a confrontation. This seems too                  confrontational and adversary, but it isn't. I know how embarassed I get when I get into the smallest confrontation, so I don't even get to the point "of being self-assured and confident without             being aggressive to defend a PoV".
    e. Need to work on self-acceptance to fully overcome this, on understanding that confrontation is part of life but it can also be helpful. Digging for the truth, even just reaching for a common                 compromise, if full of lesson and therefore should always be prized and kept as a north star, even if in the process of getting closer to the truth you need to face some "confrontations"
    f. Also, to conclude: if you don't defent your ideas, no one else will. You need to stand up for yourself


...

In no particular order, here are a couple of things that come to mind when thinking about goals:

1. Improving - There's a lot of stuff that I'd like to learn, stuff that I'd like to be able to do. Just a couple of examples, again, in no particular order:
  III. Learn how to say no and stand my ground, both politely and in heated situations
  IV.  Learn being more assertive
  V.   Learn to better manage and acquire power
  VI.  Learn new cooking recipes
  VII. Learn a new fact each day. For this, potentially read new books. Remember: you need both fiction and non-fiction in your life.
2. Money - I feel like money, as of now, has been a limiting and limited factor in my life. I want not to be bounded by it, so:
  I.   Get paid well, which probably means change job/career. Considering the savings, house and lifestyle I'd wanna have, I'd say that 3500€ is the lower band. 4k are more comfortable (2x my current salary)
  II.  Understand how to better market the skills you have and make the first money online
  III. Get back to investing a sum, each month. 1000€/month sounds like a solid amount, but should come only after 3.I.
3. Nest - The more time goes by, the more I feel the need to grow roots. I feel out of place all the time, it feels like I don't have a place in the world, so this seems like a good way to address it
  I.   Buy a house (at least 100m2)
  II.  Furnish it like all those instagram posts that make living look bearable
  III. Living Room: needs to have cozy couches, warm light, books, coffee-table-books, plants, ideally wood and heated floor (potentially consoles as well)
  IV.  Studio/Man-Cave: needs to have lots of books and a strong-ass desktop setup. Second screen, plants, back-lit monitor, comfy chair for 10h+ of daily use
  V.   Bedroom: can be modest, relatively small, if I have the studio I don't need much space. As long as it's comfy, it has a 50inch + OLED TV, then we're good
  VI.  Bathroom: can be modest, but I'd like it to have a bathtub
  VII. Kitchen: I'd like it to be a big part of it. One of the things I'd like to improve a lot in is cooking, and in general, the sense of the nest etc. 
                comes a lot from cooking at home and nurturing that environmnent where life happens
  VIII.Second Bedroom: I'd like to rent it out at the very beginning, then keeping it for me for kids/miscellaneous
4. Health - In the last 10 years I've let my health slip as a priority. No more. I can't afford it any longer
  I.   Gym
  II.  Eating Healthy
  III. Hygene
  IV.  Skin Care - Learn about it and understand if there is such a thing; does it even work?
5. Companionship - We are social animals, as much as I'd like to forget this simple fact, it's still there, chasing me and reminding me of its importance
  I.   In the last 5 years, I've let friendships slip away and I don't even know why. Now I've come to the realizaiton that they are the very foundation and anchor that keeps us sane
  II.  Girls. Need to work on that buddy... Life is long if you're alone. The best moments need to be shared. Is there such a thing as joy or happiness if not shared?
