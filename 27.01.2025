So

Here we are, I'm back.

I want to turn this into a habit, so my goal, among the ones that I listed yesterday, is to go at it and be consistent.
In fact, one of the main things that I want to dissect and deep dive into, is the act of dedication and its interrelation with habit forming, agency and success.
It's not enough to list out goals, which I did already, even though at a relatively high-level. The next step is to reverse engineer these goals and get to a list of actionable tasks that, when put in place with a certain commitment and dedication, can guide me through the mundane and the ordinary in reaching my milestones.

Apologies in advance for being obvious from time to time (or all-the-time), but I think that before everything else, just pouring out my thoughts can be, itself, an aid in clarifying the bigger picture.

So, let's try to dissect and dive deeper into the single goals that I listed yesterday.

1.I.   Learning to Code

    a. Generally speaking, especially now that LLMs are spreading and coding is less valuable than before, I don't want to learn "coding" in general, aimlessly. (Notice how the theme of having an objective         to work toward is recurring)
    b. Given that, wnat I mean by "learning to code" is that I want to have a foundation of some very basic IT concepts, such as: DNS, Proxy, API, IPs, Servers, etc. 
    c. Not for the sake of knowing stuff, but for the sake of building. For example, I'd like to self-host these thoughts in my personal blog. No wordpress, none of that shit. I'd like to be able to build          from scratch something (see, I don't even know what I need) that would help me get there
    d. Another example is pi-hole or being able to automate tasks with a macropad. Also, other than software, I'm getting quite interested in hardware as well. For example, raspberry pi, arduino, the               macropad itself, are all things that, on a level, fascinate me

1.II.  Learn to play an instrument

    a. Here there is not that much to say. But maybe, I'm wrong.
    b. Essentially I think in my life I've always lacked this part, I've never had a creative outlet and I realized later that instead of learning for the sake of learning, or learning for the sake of              interpreting (as I like to think my Uni taught me), I need to be able to express myself and to build! Music, I think that would allow me to do both.
       One thing that's pretty sad about it is that, if I've had the itch in the past to lear to produce music (there was a period when I bought midi+keyboard and I was dabbling with LogicPro), today I feel        like do to AI being able to do it I have less motivation. Pretty fucked up if you think about it, but this is a me-issue that I should address if I really found it blocking/limiting
    c. So, getting back to the main point, between it being a mean of expression and it helping me release some creativity, I also think that this stuff would get my synapses working better and those               bitches would fire and jump across those bridges. What was it? Dendritis, Axon Terminals and some other stuff. Sapolsky I'm sorry I've let you down. I'll try to be a better macaque
    d. Why guitar and piano? Well. Both for the easy of use and portability I guess. Guitar seems like a good beginner instrument. Piano I think would me more in line with me and would fit better, overall,         with my personality, whatever that means
    e. So, since I have both of these, maybe I'd better start and do something about it, what do you think? As an example, I could bring here the Piano from back home, so that at least I don't have anymore         excuses. Before doing so I could buy the stand, or whatever that thing is called

1.III. Learn how to say no and stand my ground, both politely and in heated situations

    a. Here the situation gets complicated, but at the same time simpler. Meaning that generally speaking, I've known that this is an improvement area for a while now. And I actually did improve a lot!
    b. So it's not doing the thing, per se, but beign more comfortable in doing it in such a way that I understand that even though I might offend/let down the counterpart, I still have to stand my ground          because I (should) come first. It happened a lot in my personal life, but it happened much more when working, especially because my job requires a lot of client-interaction and I find it difficult to        say stuff like "no we can't do it" or "no, this is a product limitation". Which obviously, on one side, pushes me to deliver more and to push further the limits and capabilities that the tool offers, 
       but on the other side makes me feel like I owe them something. When, in fact, I should just use these as times to improve my ability to dance around questioins, politely decline to answer or simply          changing the direction of the conversation. 
    c. In any case, long story short: this is an ongoing issue/opportunity. I've grown a lot in this regard, but there is still a lot of work to do. My approach derives mainly from my upbringing, with all          its limits and traumas, but it nonetheless brought me here.

1.IV.  Learn being more assertive

    a. This links very well with the above points in 1.III.
    b. Assertiveness is the quality of being self-assured and confident without being aggressive to defend a right point of view or a relevant statement. It is a skill that can be learned
    c. I think that the definition is pretty self explanatory and my aim as well. 
    d. Due to my upbringing and past I think that I've always leaned more on the agreable side and I've always preferred to let the other part win instead of facing a confrontation. This seems too                  confrontational and adversary, but it isn't. I know how embarassed I get when I get into the smallest confrontation, so I don't even get to the point "of being self-assured and confident without             being aggressive to defend a PoV".
    e. Need to work on self-acceptance to fully overcome this, on understanding that confrontation is part of life but it can also be helpful. Digging for the truth, even just reaching for a common                 compromise, if full of lesson and therefore should always be prized and kept as a north star, even if in the process of getting closer to the truth you need to face some "confrontations"
    f. Also, to conclude: if you don't defent your ideas, no one else will. You need to stand up for yourself. You will benefit from it tremendously. Also, remember: you can just do things.

1.V.   Learn to better manage and acquire power

    a. Well... Here things get fuzzy.
    b. Not because I don't like power, or because I've never had situations in the past where I had power and could (and sometimes did) exercise it, but because acquiring power, inherently, is the result of        a confrontation where one person loses it and the other gains it.
    c. So, if we look at point IV, given how non-confrontational I'd like to be, rarely do I acquire power if not when it comes exogenously (e.g., someone attributes it to me because of other factors, such         as (1) competence, (2) scapegoating). If I want to advance in life though, especially in the work environment, I think that I need to grow a pair and show some teeth. 
    d. I'm especially bad at scheming and crafting the right narrative that elevates me and belittles others, but because of this I've often been surpassed and kicked aside because, well... Business is             ruthless
    e. Other than what's above there's not much to say, except for: managing and acquiring power is something that can be learned. See OB377: THE PATHS TO POWER, Jeffrey Pfeffer

1.VI.  Learn new cooking recipes

    a. That's quite a change of topic, isn't it?
    b. Here, luckily, there truly isn't much to say. Bottom line is: I suck at cooking, I feel like I'm still 18 and I just left home for Uni, but those times have long gone by now.
    c. Creativity, Satisfaction and Independence are only a few factors that come into place

1.VII. Learn a new fact each day
    
    a. Again, not much to say.
    b. I like to be knowledgeable, what can I say? I'm the annoying one that has to interject with "well, actuallyyy" (even though I'm really trying to keep it at a minimum)
    c. Generally speaking though, I don't think that being more knowledgeable is bad. In fact, quite the opposite. The crucial thing is to focus on the right things my attention.
    d. So, either I find a website like "xxx fact I've learned this year" and I go point by point, or I build my own "wiki" or, to better say, learning path.


It didn't take much to understand that what I've done above is not necessarily to split the main goal into actionable points, but more of an "unpacking" of why that specific point has been mentioned in the list, where I'm now in regards to it and what's the context/background.
Anyway, I like this exercise, so I think I'll keep doing it for the next 2/3 days, until I've unpacked everything and then we'll go from there.
Oh and btw. It is expected that I won't be able to work on each single point every single day. Days, even weeks, might go by where I left some of these on hold, but it's important that directionally, I'm moving toward the goal and that I'm closing the gap between the life I wanna life and the life I (get) have to live

As an example, today I went running during my launch break. Not easy to do, given the type of work that I have, so is't something to be appreaciative of. Similarly to that, I'm about to close this because I'm going to go read a bit (at least half an hour) before bed.

Just remember: the actions and suffering you undertake today, cast a vote on the person you want to be tomorrow. So vote well. Vote with your brain, not your guts.
