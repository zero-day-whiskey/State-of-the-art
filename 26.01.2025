So the idea behind this is to self host a blog where I get the creative juices flowing and can just rant about anything that comes to mind.
I just saw a couple of movies about hacking, so I got really pumped about it and decided to do something with my life and writing seemed like a good place to begin from.
Generally speaking I don't write much, so this might be a useful exercise to carry out in the spare time and hopefully I could get some sense of direction and agency about my wearabouts and direction. 

Today blog post I guess it's just a general rant, aimed at nothing, very confused and honestly.. boring. 
But one thing for sure that I'll need to change, and in fact I am working on at this very moment, is to aim, to fill life with intentionality. 
As I like to quote, there is no favourable wind for the sailor who doesn't know where to go. 

So, let's try not to be that sailor.
Let's try to be an intentional sailor, one that does it for the love of the game, but at the same time has a plan and has a goal. 
No more aimlessness in life, from now on let's put on our Jack Sparrow pants and let's go conquer the fucking seven seas.

What are my seven seas?

...

In no particular order, here are a couple of things that come to mind when thinking about goals:

1. Improving - There's a lot of stuff that I'd like to learn, stuff that I'd like to be able to do. Just a couple of examples, again, in no particular order:
  I.   Learn to code
  II.  Learn to play an instrument (piano a guitar are in the top list as of now, with piano being #1)
  III. Learn how to say no and stand my ground, both politely and in heated situations
  IV.  Learn being more assertive
  V.   Learn to better manage and acquire power
  VI.  Learn new cooking recipes
  VII. Learn a new fact each day. For this, potentially read new books. Remember: you need both fiction and non-fiction in your life.
2. Money - I feel like money, as of now, has been a limiting and limited factor in my life. I want not to be bounded by it, so:
  I.   Get paid well, which probably means change job/career. Considering the savings, house and lifestyle I'd wanna have, I'd say that 3500€ is the lower band. 4k are more comfortable (2x my current salary)
  II.  Understand how to better market the skills you have and make the first money online
  III. Get back to investing a sum, each month. 1000€/month sounds like a solid amount, but should come only after 3.I.
3. Nest - The more time goes by, the more I feel the need to grow roots. I feel out of place all the time, it feels like I don't have a place in the world, so this seems like a good way to address it
  I.   Buy a house (at least 100m2)
  II.  Furnish it like all those instagram posts that make living look bearable
  III. Living Room: needs to have cozy couches, warm light, books, coffee-table-books, plants, ideally wood and heated floor (potentially consoles as well)
  IV.  Studio/Man-Cave: needs to have lots of books and a strong-ass desktop setup. Second screen, plants, back-lit monitor, comfy chair for 10h+ of daily use
  V.   Bedroom: can be modest, relatively small, if I have the studio I don't need much space. As long as it's comfy, it has a 50inch + OLED TV, then we're good
  VI.  Bathroom: can be modest, but I'd like it to have a bathtub
  VII. Kitchen: I'd like it to be a big part of it. One of the things I'd like to improve a lot in is cooking, and in general, the sense of the nest etc. 
                comes a lot from cooking at home and nurturing that environmnent where life happens
  VIII.Second Bedroom: I'd like to rent it out at the very beginning, then keeping it for me for kids/miscellaneous
4. Health - In the last 10 years I've let my health slip as a priority. No more. I can't afford it any longer
  I.   Gym
  II.  Eating Healthy
  III. Hygene
  IV.  Skin Care - Learn about it and understand if there is such a thing; does it even work?
5. Companionship - We are social animals, as much as I'd like to forget this simple fact, it's still there, chasing me and reminding me of its importance
  I.   In the last 5 years, I've let friendships slip away and I don't even know why. Now I've come to the realizaiton that they are the very foundation and anchor that keeps us sane
  II.  Girls. Need to work on that buddy... Life is long if you're alone. The best moments need to be shared. Is there such a thing as joy or happiness if not shared?
