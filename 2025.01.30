I started to cheat a little.

And to be honest, I didn't just start, I was always doing it. 
Always doing it normalizes it, and in some sense it corrupts our soul. Extreme transparency came to mind. And soon after I realize that the phrase that circulates was a different one ( Radical Transparency, shoutout mr. Dalio). Propably extreme transparency was a a mix between extreme ownership (shoutout to jocko) and radical transparency.
Anyway, getting of the tangent, I started to cheat a little, yes. Meaning that I created this commit yesterday, but it was empty. I'm typing this the next day, at 8.15, before work, because yesterday I was so tired that I didn't feel like doing this. And you know, I had my reasons. I woke up at 6, stayed at the office until 8pm, got home, ate, showered, and by the time I finished everything, I was so tired that I felt my eyes drying up. Also, on top of all this, my mac had 0 battery, so it had to stay plugged in, and since the charger is far from the desk where I have my setup and second monitor, I had to wait. Because, ovbiously, I couldn't move the charger closer to the desk, right?
Small, made-up, non-existant hurdles such as these, are essentially what's holding me back from doing everything I can during the day.
You know what I did when I got home yesterday? I plugged in the mac, thought to myself "let's wait til this charges up a bit and then I'll go write down the daily thoughts as usual. In the meanwhile, let's browse some instagram and youtube, but just for a quick 15 minutes". Obviously that 15' turned into 45 minutes or more, and then, since I was already laying in bed, my eyes started to dry up and I was so sleepy that I said fuck it, let's think about this tomorrow.

Long story short, that's what is keeping me from achieving everything I need to achieve. 
1. I need to be honest with myself
2. I need to take extreme ownership with my actions and life. I have agency. Shoutout to Ms. Agnes Callard.
3. I need to spend my time on things that I cherish and find valuable. As said in the past, the value of social media, youtube, etc. etc., is huge, in small doses, but the returns are steeply downward sloping

Having said this, yesterday was a good day as well. I was able to close a lot of stuff at work and progress, so I felt good on that side.
But when chatting with the manager of the projects I'm working on, he slipped that a new colleague is joining in about a month and she's gonna be staffed on the new project that I wanted to be staffed on.
When he said it, and when he laid out how he thought I could get involved in some other technical capacity within that stream but not in the full all-encompassing front-facing role that I aspired to, my immediate thought was "Oh, really? I'll show you how I'm not a bench player that can be there to support others. I'm the fucking protagonist of my story. I don't want to be number two of anything. Expect my resignation in the next few weeks". 
That was the immediate thought. If you think about it, this has a lot of sub-strate and can be analyzed on different levels.
1. To begin with, probably the thing that hurt me the most, is that I didn't even get asked what I thought about it. This shows that I do not have yet a seat at the table. No one asked "heyyo, what would you say if we thought about involving you in the new project that's starting soon?". I understand it's not a democracy, it's a workplaced, there are managers and managed (at least in our individual dynamic those are the roles), so decisions come top-down, often without consideration and even without just having an informal chat to get the sentiment from the counterpart. Point #1 is probably the most hurtful one, especially since I do not fully respect those that take decisions
2. 

I went pooping in the meanwhile and forgot everything that I wanted to say. Probably it was not that important. Or probably, I forgot it because I was imagining and thinking out loud scenarios when this project goes belly up and they come to me to "have a talk". I don't feel responsible for this mess; I didn't get the tools to get it done

Fuck meh, it's now 13:15

Morning went well, the calendar was full, I had plenty on my plate, so no time to think/browse socials, to that's already awesome.
And btw, lately I picked up the habit of having breakfast at a small caf√®/bakery. Damn, it's nice. Even though it'd be nicer if I was more outgoing and got to know locals, the owners, etc. As of now there's not much exchange, and the same goes for the pizza place where I go. I need to work on this, since I think that these small relationships and in general small talk is what's all about. Well, not all, but you get the point. I think that this helps a lot in making a place feeling like home. 

Going back to this morning's topic, I think that I was bitter for that choice because it made me realize that (1) I don't have a seat at the table, (2) I am expendable, (3) I may be not good enough, at least not up to standard. All three points hurt a lot, especially #3, which is itself reinforced because of my low self-worth and in general and doubt in my skills. Which is somewhat due to reality: I often make mistakes and I feel like I'm not the most knowleadgeable. Which itself, might be due to different factors:
a. For sure there is a time-component, meaning that in my current job we are stretched so thin that it's impossible to be on top of everything and therefore one has to make choices
  a.1. This could also be a consequence of my poor time-management skills, which itself is something that I am something that I'm somewhat aware. I say "somewhat" because it's not completely clear to me where my poor-planning stops and where being stretched too thin begins
b. I also often chose to not go too much in depth. Sometimes intentionally (e.g., when I don't care that much about a topic), other times unconsciously (e.g., when I am satisfied with a certain conclusion and don't ask myself the right questions). Asking the right questions is essential to progress and it's really something that I need to work on
